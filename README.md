# SkillPulse — GitHub Actions & Kubernetes Masterclass

A small, real application with a real CI/CD pipeline. The app — SkillPulse — lets you track skills you're learning and the hours you put in. The point isn't the app. The point is everything around it: how a single `git push` becomes a running update on a server in under two minutes, with no human pressing any button.

This repo is the working demo for the **TrainWithShubham GitHub Actions & Kubernetes Masterclass**.

> **New here? Start with the full beginner's guide:** [`docs/skillpulse-cicd-guide.pdf`](docs/skillpulse-cicd-guide.pdf) — a 29-page step-by-step walkthrough covering the foundations (DevOps, CI/CD, containers, GitHub Actions, EC2), how this pipeline is built line-by-line, how to deploy your own copy from scratch, the engineering rationale behind each design choice, and how to talk about this project on your resume and in interviews.

## Why DevOps matters

For most of software's history, the people who *wrote* software and the people who *ran* it were two different teams with two different goals.

- Developers wanted to ship features.
- Operations wanted stability.

The fastest way for ops to be stable was to slow developers down. The fastest way for developers to ship was to throw code over the wall. Both teams were right. Both teams were also miserable. And the customer paid the price — releases happened once a quarter, every release was scary, and bugs took weeks to fix.

DevOps is the cultural and technical answer to that: *the same team owns the change all the way to production, and tooling makes that safe.* It's not a job title. It's a way of working that says small, frequent, automated, and reversible beats big, rare, manual, and irreversible — every time.

When DevOps is working you can tell because:

- **Deploys are boring.** Friday afternoon, Monday morning, doesn't matter.
- **Rollbacks are cheap.** A bad deploy is a 30-second fix, not an incident.
- **Feedback is fast.** A broken commit fails CI in minutes, not "after QA next sprint."
- **Ownership is clear.** The person who wrote the code is the person who watches it ship.

You get there by automating the path from a developer's laptop to production. That automation is called a **pipeline**.

## Why CI/CD is the heart of DevOps

CI/CD is two ideas wearing one acronym.

- **Continuous Integration** — every change, from every developer, gets built and tested automatically the moment it lands. You catch breakage in minutes, not days. Merge conflicts shrink because nobody's branch lives for two weeks.
- **Continuous Delivery / Deployment** — every change that passes CI is automatically packaged and shipped — to staging, or all the way to production. There is no "deploy day." Every commit is a candidate release.

The reason this matters: the cost of fixing a bug grows with the time between writing it and finding it. CI/CD shortens that gap to minutes. The reason it's hard: the only way to make it work is to *automate everything*. Build, test, package, deploy, verify. No "just run this script on my laptop" steps. If a human has to remember it, it will eventually be forgotten — and then it will fail at 2 a.m.

## Why GitHub Actions

A pipeline needs a runner — something that watches your repo, executes your build/test/deploy steps, and reports back. Historically that meant standing up a Jenkins server, paying for CircleCI, or wiring something custom. All of those still work; none of them are the lowest-friction option in 2026.

GitHub Actions wins on three things:

1. **It lives where the code lives.** No separate server, no separate auth, no separate UI. Your `.github/workflows/*.yml` files are part of the repo — they evolve with the code, get reviewed in the same PRs, and survive every clone.
2. **It's free for public repos and generous for private ones.** A complete CI/CD pipeline costs zero rupees to start.
3. **The Marketplace is enormous.** Need to SSH into a server? `appleboy/ssh-action`. Need to log in to Docker Hub? `docker/login-action`. You compose pre-built blocks instead of writing bash from scratch.

The trade-off is GitHub lock-in. For most teams, that's a fair price for the integration.

A real pipeline, end to end, in roughly 50 lines of YAML.

### CI — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Triggered on every push to `main`. It does four things:

1. **Checks out the code.** A fresh clone in a clean Ubuntu runner — no laptop state to leak.
2. **Builds two Docker images.** A Go backend and an Nginx-served frontend. Both are multi-stage so the final images are small.
3. **Tags each image twice.** With the commit SHA (`:abc1234…`) and with `:latest`. The SHA tag is your rollback handle — you can always pin a deploy to an exact commit. The `:latest` tag is what production pulls.
4. **Pushes both to Docker Hub.** Authenticated with secrets (`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`) — never plaintext credentials in the repo.

The non-obvious lesson: **CI doesn't just test your code. It produces an artifact.** That artifact — the image — is what production runs. If the artifact is built consistently in CI, it's the same in dev, staging, and prod. "Works on my machine" stops being a possibility.

### CD — `.github/workflows/cd.yml`

Triggered automatically when CI completes successfully (`workflow_run` + a `conclusion == 'success'` gate). Skipped if CI failed — you cannot deploy a broken build.

It SSHes into an EC2 instance and runs:

```bash
if [ ! -d ~/skillpulse ]; then
  git clone <this repo> ~/skillpulse
fi
cd ~/skillpulse
git pull origin main
[ -f .env ] || { echo "ERROR: .env missing"; exit 1; }
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker image prune -f
```

Every line earns its place:

- The `if [ ! -d ... ]` makes the script **idempotent** — the same script runs whether it's the first deploy or the hundredth.
- The `.env` check fails *loudly* with a useful message instead of letting `docker compose` produce a cryptic error about missing variables.
- `docker compose pull` brings in the image you just built. `up -d` only recreates containers whose image actually changed — backend and DB don't get bounced if you only edited frontend HTML.
- `docker image prune -f` keeps the EC2 disk from filling up with old image layers over weeks of deploys.

### Secrets used

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub account name |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | A Docker Hub Personal Access Token with read+write scope |
| `EC2_HOST` | Public IP or DNS of the deploy target |
| `EC2_USER` | Linux user on the EC2 (typically `ubuntu`) |
| `EC2_SSH_KEY` | Private key contents — paste the entire `.pem` file as the secret value |

Set them at `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions` on your fork.

## The application itself

A three-tier app — kept tiny on purpose so the pipeline is the star.

| Tier | Tech | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML + CSS + vanilla JS, served by Nginx | UI for adding skills and logging hours |
| Backend | Go 1.26 + Gin | REST API at `/api/...` |
| Database | MySQL 8.4 | Stores skills and learning logs |

Nginx in the frontend image also reverse-proxies `/api/` and `/health` to the backend, so the public surface is a single port (`80`).

API surface:

```
GET    /api/skills              list skills + total hours
POST   /api/skills              create skill
GET    /api/skills/:id          one skill + its logs
DELETE /api/skills/:id          delete skill (cascades logs)
POST   /api/skills/:id/log      log a study session
GET    /api/dashboard           summary counters
GET    /health                  DB ping for healthchecks
```

---

## Run it locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env             # fill in DOCKERHUB_USERNAME (anything works for local)
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost. Backend port 8080 is intentionally not exposed — all traffic goes through Nginx, exactly like production.

To tear down:

```bash
docker compose down -v           # -v also drops the MySQL volume
```

---

## Deploy your own copy

1. **Fork this repo.**
2. **Provision an Ubuntu EC2** (any size; `t3.micro` is enough to learn). Open ports `22` (your IP) and `80` (the world). Note the public IP and the `.pem` key.
3. **Install Docker on the EC2:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
   ```
4. **Create `~/skillpulse/.env` on the EC2** with the same variables as `.env.example` plus your Docker Hub username.
5. **Add the five secrets** to your fork's repo settings (see table above).
6. **Push any commit to `main`.** Watch the Actions tab. ~90 seconds later, your EC2 IP serves the app.

Break it on purpose to learn:

- Push a commit that fails to build → CD is *skipped*, not run-and-failed.
- Rotate the Docker Hub token → next CI fails at the login step. Now you know what an expired credential looks like in logs.
- Delete `~/skillpulse/.env` on the EC2 → next CD exits with the explicit error message instead of a cryptic compose failure.

## Project layout

```
backend/                Go service
  Dockerfile            multi-stage: golang:1.26-alpine → alpine:3.23
  main.go               wires routes, reads PORT env
  database/db.go        connects to MySQL with retry-loop
  handlers/             skills, logs, dashboard endpoints
  models/               request/response structs

frontend/               static UI + Nginx config
  Dockerfile            FROM nginx:alpine, copies html/css/js + nginx.conf
  index.html, css/, js/ vanilla — no build step
  nginx.conf            serves the site, proxies /api/ to backend:8080

mysql/init.sql          schema + seed data, mounted into the MySQL container

docker-compose.yml      three services: db, backend, frontend
.env.example            copy to .env

.github/workflows/
  ci.yml                build + push images on every main push
  cd.yml                SSH + redeploy on CI success
```

## Where this goes next

This is the **GitHub Actions** half of the masterclass. The pipeline currently deploys to a single EC2 via SSH + docker compose — a fine starting point, and the most common "first real pipeline" in the industry.

The Kubernetes half of the course evolves this same app onto a cluster:

- Replace `docker compose` with manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress).
- Replace SSH-driven deploys with `kubectl apply` from CI, then with GitOps (Argo CD / Flux).
- Add health checks, autoscaling, rolling updates with no downtime, secrets via Kubernetes Secrets or external managers.
- Run the cluster on EKS / GKE / AKS or local (kind / minikube).

Same app. Same pipeline shape. Different runtime — and a lot more power.
